# coc-pilot

I just wanted copilot suggestion in the tab-completion menu for `coc.nvim`.
This plugin achieves just that, by running its own little "proxy" over the copilot LSP.

It will definitely clash with `copilot.vim`.

## Install

`:CocInstall coc-pilot`

## Setup

`:CocCommand coc-pilot.signIn` on first run.

## License
